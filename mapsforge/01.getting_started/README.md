Getting Started
===============

This is the sample from

https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started-Android-App.md

adapted to itsdown. use diff agains ../template/ to see what was added to see a
map.

two thinks were changed compared to the original getting-started: the app
allows multiple map files (which should be mandatory nowadays) and it allows a
home-grown theme.
